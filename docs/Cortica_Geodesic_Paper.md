# Cortica: Geodesic Data Structures for AGI Memory Systems
**Nathan A. Lucy**

## Abstract
This paper outlines a conceptual framework for memory in artificial general intelligence (AGI) based on geodesic data structures. Cortica models memory as a bounded conceptual topology, where distance encodes meaning and curvature encodes context. Rather than relying on hierarchical graphs, vector embeddings, or symbolic systems, this approach treats knowledge as a continuous surface of related ideas. The resulting topology supports bounded retrieval, interpretability, and tolerance for contradiction. By embedding cognition within geometry itself, Cortica seeks to provide a substrate for agents capable of reflection, coherence, and long-term contextual learning.

## 1. Introduction
Contemporary AI memory systems typically fall into three broad categories: hierarchical (trees, graphs), distributed (vector embeddings), and symbolic (knowledge bases). Each paradigm captures a fragment of cognition, but few achieve a balance of plasticity, coherence, and explainability.

Human cognition, by contrast, maintains continuity amid ambiguity. It tolerates contradiction, contextual drift, and semantic overlap — while still preserving a thread of recognizable meaning. Cortica draws inspiration from this property by treating memory not as discrete storage, but as a geodesic manifold: a continuous conceptual surface where related ideas settle by resonance rather than by index.

## 2. Geodesic Representation of Knowledge
In this framework, concepts occupy stable positions on a bounded manifold. Curvature reflects contextual forces; distance reflects semantic divergence. This structure replaces rigid linkages with continuous geometry.

Retrieval becomes an act of navigation rather than lookup — a pathfinding process through conceptual space. Queries traverse the manifold along geodesics (shortest paths), surfacing relevant memories without relying on brittle hierarchies or opaque embedding vectors.

Whereas conventional vector systems capture statistical proximity, geodesic structures capture topological coherence — a higher-order relationship that evolves over time without structural collapse.

## 3. Key Properties
Cortica introduces several theoretical advantages for long-lived, context-sensitive agents:

- **Bounded Retrieval**: Memory lives within a finite conceptual domain, supporting efficiency and interpretability.
- **Conflict Tolerance**: Contradictory representations can coexist without destructive overwriting.
- **Local Schema Evolution**: Adaptation occurs locally, minimizing global reindexing or retraining.
- **Variable Resolution**: Granularity adjusts dynamically based on context or retrieval demands.
- **Interpretability**: Geometry itself becomes the map — an intrinsic explanation of how concepts relate.

These properties make Cortica well-suited to agents that must maintain self-consistency over time while continuously learning.

## 4. Relation to Existing Systems

| Paradigm | Limitation | Geodesic Approach |
|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Knowledge Graphs | Brittle hierarchies, manual linking | Continuous surfaces without discrete edges |
| Vector Databases | Opaque embeddings, flat statistical similarity | Bounded topology with semantic resonance |
| Symbolic Systems | Rigid logic, low ambiguity tolerance | Contextual coexistence of conflicting ideas |

Cortica does not aim to merge these systems. It reframes them — grounding structure, relation, and ambiguity within a unified geometric substrate.

## 5. Philosophical Implications
If perception is captured by deep learning, and language by transformers, then understanding — the relational substrate beneath both — may require geometry.

Cortica encodes meaning not through storage, but through structure. It offers a model for agents that can ruminate, reinterpret, and maintain continuity of identity across time and shifting context.

The goal is not to mimic human thought, but to provide a principled substrate for cognition — one that learns not through accumulation, but through relation. A memory of emergent coherence.

## 6. Future Work
Ongoing research will explore benchmark comparisons between geodesic architectures and traditional vector or graph-based systems. Key metrics include:

- Retrieval stability across time
- Tolerance to conflicting or ambiguous inputs
- Topological coherence under memory updates

Mathematical formalism and implementation details will be released in a future technical paper.

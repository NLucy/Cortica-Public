# Cortica-Public

**A Geometric Substrate for AGI Memory**

This repository introduces a new memory framework — the *Geodesic Data Structure* — designed to support scalable, long-term conceptual memory in LLM-based agents.

Inspired by principles of spatial efficiency, semantic clustering, and bounded traversal, this framework offers an alternative to traditional vector stores and knowledge graphs. It is particularly suited to domains requiring evolving context, memory compression, and subjective inference.

This is a **position paper** for public reference. It outlines the theoretical foundation and computational priorities of the system while intentionally omitting proprietary architectural details.
